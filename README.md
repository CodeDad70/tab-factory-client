# TabFactory

Welcome to the TabFactory! 

This is my portfolio project for the Flatiron School using Rails with a React and Redux front end. 
It is a CRUD app that lets you create and edit guitar tabs of your favorite songs. 

--------------------------------
There are two seperate repositories you need to run to use this app. 

Fork and clone tab-factory-api :
https://github.com/CodeDad70/tab-factory-api


Run bundle install inside the tab-factory-api directory.

Create your tables by running rake:db migrate

In your terminal run Rails s -p 3001 to start a local server 

Fork and clone tab-factory-client :
https://github.com/CodeDad70/tab-factory-client

In a separate terminal window go to the tab-factory-client 
first run npm install 
then run a client 
by entering yarn start 

in your browser go to : 
http://localhost:3000/

You are good to go!
